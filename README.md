# diceware

A Python script to generate diceware passwords. Inspired by [XKCD 1501](https://xkcd.com/936/) and [XKCD Password Generator](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/). Unfortunately, many websites require special characters. This password generator will create diceware passwords that contains the special characters.
